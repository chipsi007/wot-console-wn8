# wot-console-wn8

A script to generate WN8 for World Of Tanks Console from player data.


With PC community moving towards WN8 v30 expected values, the task of generating Console values became much easier. All that has to be done to get the Console values is to normalize all the tanks in the game across 50 categories (tier-type combinations). This gives underperforming tanks lower expected values and better performing tanks - higher while keeping overall median of the tier-type at the level defined with WN8 PC v30.
